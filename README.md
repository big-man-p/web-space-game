# Web Space Shooter
**A lightweight space shooter game and mini game engine built from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

This project was created to explore how core game engine concepts can be implemented in the browser without using any external libraries or frameworks. All rendering, physics, collision detection, and game logic are handled manually using the native web platform.

## 🎮 Overview
The game is a classic 2D space shooter where the player controls a ship, avoids enemies, and fires projectiles. Beyond gameplay, the focus of this project is on building the underlying systems that power the game.

This includes:
* Custom movement and physics logic
* Vector-based calculations
* Collision detection
* Game loop and state management

## ✨ Features
* Fully playable 2D space shooter
* Vector-based movement and direction calculations
* Manual collision detection between entities
* Keyboard input handling
* Lightweight rendering using the HTML DOM / Canvas

No external dependencies or frameworks

## 🧠 Technical Focus
This project was intentionally built from first principles to strengthen understanding of core concepts often abstracted away by engines or libraries.

Key areas researched and implemented:
* Vector mathematics for movement, direction, and velocity
* Collision detection algorithms for entity interactions
* Game loops and frame updates
* State management for entities such as player, enemies, and projectiles
* Performance-conscious updates using native browser APIs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* HTML – Game structure and canvas setup
* CSS – UI styling and layout
* JavaScript – Game engine logic, physics, and input handling

No build tools, libraries, or third-party dependencies are used.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the game in your browser:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/big-man-p/web-space-game.git
cd web-space-game
```
Open `index.html` in any modern browser to start playing.
